Hi there, Welcome to my portfolio website!
I am a software engineer with a background in digital design and illustration. I'm currently doing a data science fellowship, that was pushed me to learn about data analysis and machine learning.

3 fun facts about me: I did a stop animation workshop in Prague, The Czech Republic, I am fluent in three languages and currently learning Japanese, and I am well familiar with most dog breeds.

Below are some of my data science and fullstack engineering projects
